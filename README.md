This project focuses on evaluating the influence of process variables on manufacturing quality using polynomial regression analysis. By analyzing various process parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and time, we aim to understand their impact on the quality of manufactured products
The dataset used in this project comprises records of process variables and corresponding quality metrics collected during manufacturing operations. Each entry includes information on the process parameters and the quality outcome.
Polynomial regression is employed to model the relationship between process variables and manufacturing quality. This technique allows us to capture nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the response variable, providing valuable insights into the manufacturing process.
The project implementation involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are utilized for data manipulation, regression modeling, and performance evaluation.
