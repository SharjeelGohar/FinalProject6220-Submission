# FinalProject6220-Submission
This semester, as part of my Advanced Statistical Approaches to Quality course, I worked on a project focusing on the impact of process variables like cycle duration, temperature, and pressure on manufacturing quality. The objective was to use polynomial regression to model and predict quality outcomes based on these variables. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and collected from a manufacturing facility, aimed to capture the non-linear relationships between these variables and the final product quality. Through my analysis, I developed a polynomial regression model that improved prediction accuracy and provided valuable insights for process optimization. This project not only advanced my understanding of statistical techniques in industrial applications but also demonstrated the practical implications of predictive analytics in manufacturing settings.
